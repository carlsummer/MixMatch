# MixMatch
This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of [MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249) The official Tensorflow implementation is here.

Now only experiments on CIFAR-10 are available.

This repository carefully implemented important details of the official implementation to reproduce the results.
